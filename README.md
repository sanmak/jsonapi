### [jsonapi](https://www.jsonapi.co/) is a Hosted API's platform with 24 * 7 availability to test your code for free ðŸ™Œ

### Why do world need such platform ?

Yes, definitely. As a developer/programmer/coder when i'm developing any frontend or mobile app, we need api's to integrate. 
Generally developer uses mock json structure in place of api's or create local server's to test end-to-end integration.

Problem with this approach is, there can be tons of issues that can pop up while deploying this app. Because it was never tested with a hosted api, things are bound to break.

### Solution

To solve it, [jsonapi](https://www.jsonapi.co/) is developed to save time, effort and energy. With our hosted api's which covers extensively all set of HTTP methods, error handling, datasets, json structure, it helps to keep our focus more on app development and api painpoints is handled by [jsonapi](https://www.jsonapi.co/). Code snippets added in website to help understand api's better
